##		$1: webdav server URL 
##		$2: path on webdav where .zip folders should be saved (including where it is 
##			mounted on your computer (e.g /path_on_webdav)
##		$3: path to chore.jar (offline analys program Choreography)
##		$4: gigabytes of memory to be used to run Choreography (dependent upon

## Connect to webdav (so you can backup files)
## you will be prompted for your webdav username and password

## Use regular expressions in R to parse apart the information in the filepath
## so we can get data, plate ID and strain as delimited columns
## call R script with the command line using an argument for the filename we want to parse
   rscript bin/Column_identification_command.R data/chore_data/merged.file
